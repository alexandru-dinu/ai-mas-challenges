- map gestures to app events
- pipeline
    - localization
    - gesture recognition
    - mapping gestures to app events
- sdk:
    - app exposes detected gestures -> it's up to another dev to use them


algorithmic challenges
    - noisy data
    - robustness: contrast (lighting, night time) / scale (distance)
    - tracking
    - real-time

development challenges
    - os load (process)
    - features
    - data

step-by-step plan


Performance - the system either directly interacts with an application
(e.g. volume control for VLC media player), or exposes some gesture events
(e.g. SwipeLeft, RotateClockwise etc) allowing an end-user to map them to
specific controls. At the end of the day we want to deliver a smooth experience,
so, performance is a critical factor.
